# GPTFromScratchHelloWorld

An implementation of a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) from scratch.  
Built as part of following Andrej Karpathy's **[Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)** video series.

## Overview

This project builds a simple GPT-style language model from the ground up, without using high-level deep learning frameworks. The goal is to deeply understand how transformers work internally by implementing all the components manually.
